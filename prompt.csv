"1. Comparison of detection methods: The 2006 Texas Air Quality Study compared data from a Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP) and a photoacoustic-based aerosol light absorption technique. These methods were used to measure the level of organic aerosol (OA) in the air, but showed varying results depending on the ratio of OA to light absorbing carbon (LAC).

2. The role of OA and LAC: The level of agreement between the two measurement methods was influenced by the amount of organic aerosol (OA) present. When the OA mass concentration was low, the two techniques showed results within their instrumental uncertainties, but as the OA to LAC ratio increased, the difference in measurements between the two techniques also became more significant.

3. Inconsistencies with high ratios of OA to LAC: When the ratio of OA to LAC mass (ROALAC) was high, the disagreement between the two methods could reach between 50 and 80 percent. This discrepancy was attributed to the bias in the filter-based measurements, as most of the organic aerosol was oxidized and non-absorbing.

1. Challenge of Feature Learning in DCNNs: One of the main challenges when using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for large-scale face recognition is formulating appropriate loss functions to enhance the discriminative capability of the system.
