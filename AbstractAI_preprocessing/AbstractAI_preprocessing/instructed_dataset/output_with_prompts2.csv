Rise of Big Data and Evidence-Based Medicine: The onset of big data is changing the landscape of healthcare, with evidence-based medicine growing in importance. This approach aims to improve medical decisions by basing them on well-conducted clinical research.

2. Use of Meta-analysis: This is a statistical technique often used in evidence-based medicine which combines findings from different independent clinical trials to give an overall estimation of a treatment's effectiveness.

3. Reporting of Trial Results: Trial results are frequently reported using different measures, such as mean, median, maximum and minimum values, or first and third quartiles. This can cause inconsistency in pooling results for meta-analysis.

4. Need for Transformation: To address this inconsistency, researchers need to transform the given information back to the sample mean and standard deviation.

5. Importance of Sample Size: The literature often either overlooks the necessity of the sample size or uses it in a somewhat arbitrary manner. Sample size has a significant impact on the reliability and accuracy of meta-analytical results.

6. Solution Proposal: The authors suggest incorporating sample size into a smoothly changing weight in the estimators to optimize estimation. This gives heed to the essential role of sample size and mitigates the limitations in existing methods.

    ### Give me a list of key points related to the abstract. Explain each point in at least two lines.","1. Limitation of Current Automatic Expression Analysis: Current systems mainly focus on recognizing prototypic expressions like happiness, anger, or fear, which are less frequently exhibited by humans. The analysis of more subtle changes in certain facial features, which humans use more often to express emotions or intentions, is neglected.

2. Development of Automatic Face Analysis (AFA): The paper details the development of an AFA system that examines facial expressions using both permanent (brows, eyes, mouth) and transient (deepening of facial furrows) facial features. This system aims to provide in-depth analysis of facial expressions, diving far beyond common prototypic expressions.

Integer Programming Formulation of Traveling Salesman Problems,1251,It has been observed by many people that a striking number of quite diverse mathematical problems can be formulated as problems in integer programming that is linear programming problems in which some or all of the variables are required to assume integral values This fact is rendered quite interesting by recent research on such problems notably by R E Gomory 2 3 which gives promise of yielding efficient computational techniques for their solution The present paper provides yet another example of the versatility of integer programming as a mathematical modeling device by representing a generalization of the wellknown Travelling Salesman Problem in integer programming terms The authors have developed several such models of which the one presented here is the most efficient in terms of generality number of variables and number of constraints This model is due to the second author 4 and was presented briefly at the Symposium on Combinatorial Problems held at Princeton University April 1960 sponsored by SIAM and IBM The problem treated is 1 A salesman is required to visit each of n cities indexed by 1  n He leaves from a base city indexed by 0 visits each of the n other cities exactly once and returns to city 0 During his travels he must return to 0 exactly t times including his final return here t may be allowed to vary and he must visit no more than p cities in one tour By a tour we mean a succession of visits to cities without stopping at city 0 It is required to find such an itinerary which minimizes the total distance traveled by the salesman Note that if t is fixed then for the problem to have a solution we must have tp  n For t  1 p  n we have the standard traveling salesman problemLet dij i  j  0 1  n be the distance covered in traveling from city i to city j The following integer programming problem will be shown to be equivalent to 1 2 Minimize the linear form 0ijn dijxij over the set determined by the relations ni0ij xij  1 j  1  n nj0ji xij  1 i  1  n ui  uj  pxij  p  1 1  i  j  n where the xij are nonnegative integers and the ui i  1  n are arbitrary real numbers We shall see that it is permissible to restrict the ui to be nonnegative integers as well If t is fixed it is necessary to add the additional relation nu1 xi0  t Note that the constraints require that xij  0 or 1 so that a natural correspondence between these two problems exists if the xij are interpreted as follows The salesman proceeds from city i to city j if and only if xij  1 Under this correspondence the form to be minimized in 2 is the total distance to be traveled by the salesman in 1 so the burden of proof is to show that the two feasible sets correspond ie a feasible solution to 2 has xij which do define a legitimate itinerary in 1 and conversely a legitimate itinerary in 1 defines xij which together with appropriate ui satisfy the constraints of 2Consider a feasible solution to 2 The number of returns to city 0 is given by ni1 xi0 The constraints of the form  xij  1 all xij nonnegative integers represent the conditions that each city other than zero is visited exactly once The ui play a role similar to node potentials in a network and the inequalities involving them serve to eliminate tours that do not begin and end at city 0 and tours that visit more than p cities Consider any xr  1 r1  0 There exists a unique r2 such that xr  1 Unless r2  0 there is a unique r3 with xr  1 We proceed in this fashion until some rj  0 This must happen since the alternative is that at some point we reach an rk  rj j  1  k Since none of the rs are zero we have ur  ur  pxr  p  1 or ur  ur   1 Summing from i  j to k  1 we have ur  ur  0  j  1  k which is a

p But we have ur  ur  pxr  p  1 or ur  ur  p 1  xr  1  p  1 which is a contradictionConversely if the xij correspond to a legitimate itinerary it is clear that the ui can be adjusted so that ui  j if city i is the jth city visited in the tour which includes city i for we then have ui  uj   1 if xij  1 and always ui  uj  p  1 The above integer program involves n2  n constraints if t is not fixed in n2  2n variables Since the inequality form of constraint is fundamental for integer programming calculations one may eliminate 2n variables say the xi0 and x0j by means of the equation constraints and produce an equivalent problem with n2  n inequalities and n2 variablesThe currently known integer programming procedures are sufficiently regular in their behavior to cast doubt on the heuristic value of machine experiments with our model However it seems appropriate to report the results of the five machine experiments we have conducted so far The solution procedure used was the allinteger algorithm of R E Gomory 3 without the ranking procedure he describesThe first three experiments were simple model verification tests on a fourcity standard traveling salesman problem with distance matrix  20 23 4 30 7 27 25 5 25 3 21 26 The first experiment was with a model now obsolete using roughly twice as many constraints and variables as the current model for this problem 28 constraints in 21 variables The machine was halted after 4000 pivot steps had failed to produce a solution The second experiment used the earlier model with the xi0 and x0j eliminated resulting in a 28constraint 15variable problem Here the machine produced the optimal solution in 41 pivot stepsThe third experiment used the current formulation with the xi0 and x0j eliminated yielding 13 constraints and 9 variables The optimal solution was reached in 7 pivot stepsThe fourth and fifth experiments were used on a standard tencity problem due to Barachet solved by Dantzig Johnson and Fulkerson 1 The current formulation was used yielding 91 constraints in 81 variables The fifth problem differed from the fourth only in that the ordering of the rows was altered to attempt to introduce more favorable pivot choices In each case the machine was stopped after over 250 pivot steps had failed to produce the solution In each case the last 100 pivot steps had failed to change the value of the objective functionIt seems hopeful that more efficient integer programming procedures now under development will yield a satisfactory algorithmic solution to the traveling salesman problem when applied to this

This is achieved by flowing the liquids on opposite sides of a microporous membrane and carefully controlling the pressure difference between the fluids.

    ### Give me a list of key points related to the abstract. Explain each point in at least two lines.","1. Visual Attention in Structural Tasks: The paper discusses how visual attention, a learning mechanism, is used in structural prediction tasks like visual captioning and question answering. This mechanism allows a model to focus on certain regions of an image over others which can help in better predictions.

2. Limitations of Existing Visual Attention Models: Current visual attention models are spatial, meaning that attention is modeled as spatial probabilities, which are used to reweight the last convolutional layer feature map of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The authors argue that this spatial attention might not fully leverage the attention mechanism as CNN features are naturally spatial, channelwise and multilayer.

3. Introduction of SCACNN: The paper introduces a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called Spatial and Channel-wise Attention CNN (SCACNN). This model incorporates spatial and channel-wise attentions into a CNN - the spatial attention identifies where the focus is and the channel-wise attention identifies what the focus is, resulting in a dynamic feature extractor.

Status of Best Performers in DEA: In most models of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), the best performing Decision Making Units (DMUs) are denoted as fully efficient, represented by unity or 100. However, it is a common occurrence that multiple DMUs achieve this status of efficiency.

2. Need for Discrimination between Efficient DMUs: This paper addresses the need to distinguish between DMUs that have achieved full efficiency. This discrimination allows for a deeper understanding of the performance quality of each DMU beyond the mere classification of efficient or inefficient.

3. Slacks-Based Measure for Efficiency: The author proposes the use of the slacks-based measure (SBM) of efficiency, a method they had previously suggested for this discrimination. The SBM takes into account the excesses (slacks) in inputs/outputs, providing a more detailed picture of each DMU's performance.

4. Comparison with Radial Measure: The SBM is contrasted with the traditional radial measure used in models like Andersen and Petersen. Unlike the radial measure, which ignores the existence of slacks, the SBM deals directly with these excesses, granting it a sense of rationality and detailed performance analysis.

    ### Give me a list of key points related to the abstract. Explain each point in at least two lines.","1. General Logic Programs: A general logic program contains positive and negative subgoals and can be viewed as a kind of deductive database. Its rules, referred to as the IDB (Intensional Database), are layered atop elementary relationships known as the EDB (Extensional Database). 

2. Herbrand Model: The Herbrand model is used to interpret the meaning, or declarative semantics, of a general logic program. All queries put into the program should ideally correspond with this model to receive an accurate response.

3. Total and Partial Models: Some programs cannot be satisfactorily interpreted with a total model. For these, a partial model must be considered. This abstract suggests that unfounded sets and wellfounded partial models are potential solutions to this challenge.

4. Wellfounded Partial Model: This describes the wellfounded semantics of a program - the program's meaning derived from this model. If this partial model actually constitutes a total model, it is referred to as a wellfounded model.

5. Inclusion of Stratified Programs: The paper indicates that programs with a total wellfounded model encompass previously analyzed stratified and locally stratified programs. This suggests a wider applicability of this model.

3. Connection to Wavelet Theory: To ease the reader into understanding the modern Hilbert-space formulation, Shannon's sampling procedure is reinterpreted as an orthogonal projection onto the subspace of band-limited functions, hence, forming a connection with wavelet theory.

4. Extension of Standard Sampling Paradigm: The paper extends the traditional sampling paradigm for presenting functions in the more general class of shift-invariant functions spaces. This includes splines and wavelets, introducing more diverse models for interpolation.

5. More Realistic Interpolation Models: The utilization of the more general class of shift-invariant functions enables simpler and potentially more realistic interpolation models. These can be used along a widerclass of prefilters that are not necessarily ideal low pass.

Wire Performance in Scaled Technologies: As technologies are reduced to smaller feature sizes, from 0.18m to 0.0035m, the performance of wires in these technologies is being questioned. The research involves examining both wire and gate delays in these scaled technologies to apprehend the extent of the wiring problem.

2. Impact on Local Wires: Wires that shorten in length as technologies scale experience delays that are either in sync with or slower than gate delays. Local wires, which constitute a major part of chip wiring, benefit from this performance scaling.

3. Need for Enhanced CAD Tools: Despite the improved performance of local wires, computer-aided design tools will need refinement to efficiently deal with them. Given that scaled technologies lead to an exponential growth in the total number of wires, CAD tools must adapt to handle an increasing percentage of wires to maintain stable designer workloads.

2. **Test Suite Growth**: With the evolution and complexity increase of a software, the test suite which contains test cases for execution also grows. It can become cost-intensive and time-consuming to run and maintain the large suite of tests.

3. **Test Suite Minimization**: This approach aims to eliminate redundant test cases, significantly reducing the number of tests to be run. In this way, unnecessary tests that don't impact the overall software's behaviour are removed, hence saving time and cost.

4. **Test Case Selection**: This strategy focuses on identifying which test cases are most relevant to the recent changes in the software. The goal is to ensure that the newly introduced or altered code doesn't break the existing functionalities.

5. **Test Case Prioritization**: This approach orders the test cases such that the test cases revealing errors are executed earlier. This maximizes early fault detection, which is crucial in quickly identifying and fixing issues with the software.

Principal Eigenvector as Priority Representation: The principal eigenvector is essential for showing the derived priorities from a positive reciprocal pairwise comparison judgment matrix. If the matrix A is a small perturbation of a consistent matrix, the principal eigenvector becomes a necessary representation. 

2. Estimation of Underlying Ratio Scale: The paper discusses how an individual, while giving numerical judgments, tries to sequentially estimate an underlying ratio scale and its equivalent coherent matrix of ratios. 

3. Importance of Near-Consistent Matrices: Near-consistent matrices are critical when dealing with intangible factors as human judgments are inherently inconsistent. If new information can improve this inconsistency towards near-consistency, then it enhances the validity of decision priorities.

Thus, once near-consistency is achieved, it becomes uncertain which coefficients should be perturbed by small amounts for transitioning a near-consistent matrix to a consistent one.

   This paper presents a new model called FBM (Fogg Behavior Model) for understanding human behavior. This model separates the behavior of individuals into three main categories: motivation, ability, and triggers. 

2. Model Components and Subcomponents:
   Each factor of the FBM model, namely motivation, ability, and triggers, has its subcomponents that contribute to a person's actions. These are the building blocks that shape our behavior.

   The model suggests the necessary conditions for the manifestation of a particular behavior or action. These are adequate motivation, capacity or ability to perform the targeted behavior, and an appropriate trigger or cue to initiate the behavior.

4. Conditions of Concurrent Occurrence: 
   One of the key outcomes of the model is that the three factors (motivation, ability, and trigger) must all occur synchronously for a target behavior to take place. In the absence of even one, the expected behavior will not manifest.

Importance of Carfollowing in Traffic Engineering: In recent years, the study of 'carfollowing', which pertains to the interaction between adjacent vehicles traveling in the same lane, has gained significant attention in traffic engineering. It aids in improving traffic flow and safety measures.

2. Use of Carfollowing Models: These models are a crucial element in multiple areas of research, particularly in simulation modelling. In these scenarios, carfollowing models manipulate and control vehicle motion within the simulation network.

3. Role in Advanced Vehicle Control and Safety Systems: The principles of carfollowing are heavily employed in the newly introduced advanced vehicle control and safety system (AVCSS). AVCSS aims at replicating driver behavior while minimizing the risk and occurrence of human error.

Proposal of a Method for Construction of Abstract State Graph: The paper proposes a unique method that helps in the automatic construction of an abstract state graph for any given system using the Pvs theorem prover. This is both a novel and a significant proposal as it introduces automation in the construction of abstract state graphs. 

2. Use of Parallel Composition of Sequential Processes: The proposed method utilises the parallel composition of sequential processes which essentially groups distinct processes that could potentially be executed simultaneously. This makes the approach effective and efficient.

3. Partition of the State space: A state space partition is induced by predicates on the program variables. This partition defines an abstract state space which is used to start building the abstract state graph.

4. Starting with Abstract Initial State: The construction of the abstract state graph starts from the abstract initial state. This ensures that the methodology accurately mirrors the original system's progression in terms of its states and variable values.

5. Calculation of Successors using Pvs theorem prover: The method utilises the Pvs theorem prover to determine the potential successors of a state. This algorithm validates for each index 'i' to see if it is a postcondition, enhancing the precision of the outcome.

A simple method for converting an odds ratio to effect size for use in meta-analysis,974,A systematic review may encompass both odds ratios and mean differences in continuous outcomes A separate metaanalysis of each type of outcome results in loss of information and may be misleading It is shown that a lnodds ratio can be converted to effect size by dividing by 181 The validity of effect size the estimate of interest divided by the residual standard deviation depends on comparable variation across studies If researchers routinely report residual standard deviation any subsequent review can combine both odds ratios and effect sizes in a single metaanalysis when this is justified Copyright C 2000 John Wiley and Sons Ltd,"Abstract: A systematic review may encompass both odds ratios and mean differences in continuous outcomes A separate metaanalysis of each type of outcome results in loss of information and may be misleading It is shown that a lnodds ratio can be converted to effect size by dividing by 181 The validity of effect size the estimate of interest divided by the residual standard deviation depends on comparable variation across studies If researchers routinely report residual standard deviation any subsequent review can combine both odds ratios and effect sizes in a single metaanalysis when this is justified Copyright C 2000 John Wiley and Sons Ltd

 
    ### Give me a list of key points related to the abstract. Explain each point in at least two lines.","1. Combining Odds Ratios and Mean Differences: The abstract discusses the scenario where a systematic review has to deal with both odds ratios and mean differences in continuous outcomes. It states that conducting separate meta-analyses for each type of outcome could lead to loss of information and potential misinterpretation.

2. Conversion of Odds Ratio to Effect Size: The authors assert that an odds ratio can be converted into effect size by dividing it by 1.81. This transformation allows for the possible combination of these two different kinds of outcomes in a single meta-analysis.

3. Dependence of Validity on Variation: The validity of the effect size, which is calculated as the estimate of interest divided by the residual standard deviation, depends on having comparable variation across the studies under consideration. If this requirement is not met, the validity of the effect size could be compromised.

4. Routinely Reporting Residual Standard Deviation: The authors recommend that researchers should routinely report the residual standard deviation. This standardized reporting will make it easier for subsequent reviews to combine odds ratios and effect sizes in a single meta-analysis when this is justified.

5. Justification for Single Meta-Analysis: The abstract implies that there needs to be a sound justification for combining both odds ratios and"

Point of Interests (POI) Recommendation Service: The study focuses on creating a recommendation service for location-based social networks (LBSNs) like Foursquare and Whrrl. These recommendations aim to provide users with tailor-made suggestions about different places or activities in a specific area based on various factors.

2. User Preference, Social Influence, and Geographical Influence: The recommendation service is developed considering three fundamental aspects - user preference, social influence, and geographical influence. The user preference is derived from user-based collaborative filtering, social influence is explored from the friends circle, and geographical influence is given special emphasis due to the spatial clustering phenomenon observed in user check-in activities.

3. Geographical Influence and User Check-in Behaviors: The research highlights that geographical influence among POIs impacts user check-in behavior on LBSNs. This influence is modeled by the power law distribution, suggesting that users are much likely to check-in a location that is geographically closer to their previous check-ins.

4. Collaborative Recommendation Algorithm: An algorithm is developed based on geographical influence and naive Bayesian principles. This algorithm fuses all three aspects (user preference, social influence, and geographical influence) to generate collaboratively recommended points of interest.
