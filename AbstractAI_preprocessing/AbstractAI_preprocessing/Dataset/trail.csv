UCSF Chimera - A visualization system for exploratory research and analysis,30035,The design implementation and capabilities of an extensible visualization system UCSF Chimera are discussed Chimera is segmented into a core that provides basic services and visualization and extensions that provide most higher level functionality This architecture ensures that the extension mechanism satisfies the demands of outside developers who wish to incorporate new features Two unusual extensions are presented Multiscale which adds the ability to visualize largescale molecular assemblies such as viral coats and Collaboratory which allows researchers to share a Chimera session interactively despite being at separate locales Other extensions include Multalign Viewer for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures ViewDock for screening docked ligand orientations Movie for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories and Volume Viewer for display and analysis of volumetric data A discussion of the usage of Chimera in realworld situations is given along with anticipated future directions Chimera includes full user documentation is free to academic and nonprofit users and is available for Microsoft Windows Linux Apple Mac OS X SGI IRIX and HP Tru64 Unix from httpwwwcglucsfeduchimera,"Abstract: The design implementation and capabilities of an extensible visualization system UCSF Chimera are discussed Chimera is segmented into a core that provides basic services and visualization and extensions that provide most higher level functionality This architecture ensures that the extension mechanism satisfies the demands of outside developers who wish to incorporate new features Two unusual extensions are presented Multiscale which adds the ability to visualize largescale molecular assemblies such as viral coats and Collaboratory which allows researchers to share a Chimera session interactively despite being at separate locales Other extensions include Multalign Viewer for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures ViewDock for screening docked ligand orientations Movie for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories and Volume Viewer for display and analysis of volumetric data A discussion of the usage of Chimera in realworld situations is given along with anticipated future directions Chimera includes full user documentation is free to academic and nonprofit users and is available for Microsoft Windows Linux Apple Mac OS X SGI IRIX and HP Tru64 Unix from httpwwwcglucsfeduchimera
