       "\n",
       "This paper proposes a novel machine Learning classifier for analyzing facial features in the pursuit of truth and lie differentiation. The classifier is trained and tested on a unique dataset comprising of both truthful and deceptive instances. Research to date has subjected the accuracy of human judgement in lie detection, thus the need for an effective and automatic lie detection based on facial features is a priority research area. Our proposed classifier leverages advanced algorithms and heuristic methodology to structure a predictive model that comprehensively analyses micro-expressions, facial movements, and other salient features that could potentially reveal the veracity of the subject under scrutiny. The primary objective of this study is not only to improve the accuracy of deception detection, but also to reduce human bias and error in the same. Experimental results show that the proposed model shows promising results in identifying deception based on the facial features extracted from the truth-lie dataset. Our machine learning classifier, therefore, sets a groundbreaking course in the application of AI in psychological, security, and law enforcement fields where credibility assessment is crucial."

    "Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R2 of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R2 of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.\n"
